 <p><b>Exercise: </b>Bulldogs aren’t incredibly athletic dogs and only require
30 minutes to 40 minutes of exercise per day, but their low energy means that
their exercise should be more spread throughout the day. They prefer low impact
exercises such as walks or fetching. Bulldogs are not made for swimming, so they
should not be allowed to swim in deep waters, but allowing them to be in a
shallow pool of water will allow them to exercise while staying cool.</p>

develop hip dysplasia, where the hip joint develops incorrectly, causing pain and

cause infections and skin irritation. Infections can cause conjunctivitis, also
known as pink eye, which causes inflammation on the eye.</p>;
