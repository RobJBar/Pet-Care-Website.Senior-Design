They are typically very friendly towards their owner and are more social than most other cats, so they can bond with their owner very quickly. Their intelligence makes them able to learn good behaviors quickly, and enjoy anything that stimulates their mind. They can become depressed and display bad behaviors if they don’t get a lot of attention or are treated with negative treatment instead of positive reinforcement.</p>
    <p><b>Activity: </b>Siamese cats require a large amount of attention from their owners and will typically follow them around and meow loudly. They enjoy being pet and it is an easy way to give them their required attention. Even with their higher love of attention compared to other cats, they still need to be given space when they need it. Siamese cats enjoy toys that allow them to use their brain, but they can get bored of these toys if they play with them for too long, so it is healthy to have a rotation of toys for them to play with. They can also be entertained with puzzle feeders, which will exercise their brain while also slowing down how fast they eat. These also need to be switched regularly.</p>
    <p><b>Common Health Issue: </b>One of the most common health issues in Siamese cats is amyloidosis, which affects the liver, causing protein deposits to build up in organs, and can cause organ failure in many cases.
